<h3>Abstract</h3>
<hr>

Steganography refers to the science of “invisible” communication. Unlike cryptography, 
where the goal is to secure communications from an eavesdropper, steganographic techniques 
strive to hide the very presence of the message itself from an observer. The general idea 
of hiding some information in digital content has a wider class of applications that go 
beyond steganography. Here we propose a new innovative technique for hiding and then retrieving 
a secret image. The technique consists of two processes viz. encoding and decoding. Main focus 
in the encoding phase is to hide the secret RGB colour image in a cover image and get some shares 
which are to be transmitted to the receiver. In the decoding phase, main focus is to get back the 
retrieved image back to the original image quality as much as possible from the shares in the 
received end.

<h3>Implementation</h3>

This project successfully implements an encoder-decoder system where we can hide a secret image 
inside another image and retrieve it secretly later using the decoder only.
